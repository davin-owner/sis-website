description: Mark tasks complete in MISSION_TRACKER.md based on what the user accomplished
---

The user will describe what they completed. Your job:

1. **Read MISSION_TRACKER.md** to understand the current state
2. **Analyze what they said** - does it match a specific task checkbox?
3. **Take action based on the match:**

   **If it matches a task:**
   - Check off the matching checkbox(es) in MISSION_TRACKER.md
   - Update the "Last Updated" date at the bottom
   - Recalculate and update the progress percentage if a major task is done
   - Tell them what you checked off and what's next

   **If it's partial progress (not a full task):**
   - Don't check anything off yet
   - Tell them exactly what's still needed to complete the task
   - Guide them on where to keep digging

   **If it doesn't match any task:**
   - Tell them where they are in the tracker
   - Suggest which task they might be working toward
   - Ask clarifying questions

4. **Be honest and precise** - only check boxes if they ACTUALLY completed the work. This tracker is about real learning, not fake progress.

**Important:**
- Update multiple checkboxes if they completed multiple things
- Be encouraging but truthful
- Always show them the next logical step after marking something complete
