## Core Architecture

### üéØ The Critical Flow

```
User Login ‚Üí Check Shop ‚Üí Create Shop (if needed) ‚Üí Dashboard ‚Üí Everything uses shop_id
```

**Key Principle:** Everything in the platform revolves around the `shop_id`

1. User signs up/logs in
2. Dashboard checks: "Do they have a shop?"
3. NO ‚Üí Show "Create Your Shop" page
4. YES ‚Üí Show main dashboard
5. All actions create records with their `shop_id`

---

## RLS Policies & Triggers

### What Needs Auto-Population

**shop_owner** (on shops_tables):
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER shops_tables_auto_set_shop_owner
  BEFORE INSERT ON shops_tables
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION auto_set_shop_owner();
```

**shop_id** (on shop_leads, shop_workers):
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER shop_leads_auto_set_shop_id
  BEFORE INSERT ON shop_leads
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION auto_set_shop_id();
```

### RLS Policy Pattern

All shop-related tables follow this pattern:
```sql
CREATE POLICY "table_name_owner_access"
  ON table_name
  FOR ALL
  USING (
    shop_id IN (
      SELECT shop_id FROM shops_tables
      WHERE shop_owner = auth.uid()
    )
  )
  WITH CHECK (
    shop_id IN (
      SELECT shop_id FROM shops_tables
      WHERE shop_owner = auth.uid()
    )
  );
```

## Shop Creation Flow

### Implementation Steps

1. **Check for Shop on Dashboard Load**
```typescript
const { data: shop } = await supabase
  .from('shops_tables')
  .select('*')
  .eq('shop_owner', user.id)
  .single();

if (!shop) {
  // Show create shop form
}
```

2. **Create Shop Context**
Global state management for current shop

3. **Build CreateShopForm**
Simple form: shop_name, shop_address, amount_of_workers

4. **Test Flow**
Signup ‚Üí Create Shop ‚Üí Create Lead ‚Üí Verify Isolation

---

## Learning Notes

### When Creating Migrations

1. Open Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor
2. Write your migration SQL
3. Test locally first if using Supabase CLI
4. Apply to production when ready

### Data Isolation

Every shop owner should ONLY see their own:
- shop_leads
- shop_workers
- shop_appointments (future)

Test by creating two users and verifying they can't see each other's data.

---

## Future Improvements

1. Fix typo: `perfered_artist_id` ‚Üí `preferred_artist_id`
2. Add table: `shop_appointments` for booking management
3. Consider: Renaming `shops_tables` to just `shops`
4. Multi-shop support: Allow users to own multiple shops
5. Team members: Multiple users per shop with roles

---

## Migration History

- `20251012_cleanup_database_schema.sql` - Initial cleanup and schema setup
  - Fixed shops_tables primary key
  - Created leads and shop_workers tables
  - Added foreign key constraints
  - Set up RLS policies
