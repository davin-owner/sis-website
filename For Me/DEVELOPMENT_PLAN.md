# Simple Ink Studios - Development Roadmap
## 3-Month Development Plan

---

## üéØ CURRENT STATUS: **60% COMPLETE**
**Last Updated**: October 8, 2025
**Current Phase**: Phase 1 - Database Foundation
**Next Milestone**: Create database schema and connect real data

### ‚úÖ What's Already Done:
- ‚úÖ **Foundation & Setup (100%)**: Next.js 15 + TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Supabase Auth
- ‚úÖ **UI & Dashboard (100%)**: Landing page, navbar, dashboard layout, settings page
- ‚úÖ **Pipeline System (80%)**: Kanban board UI with drag-and-drop (mock data), flaker tracking page
- ‚úÖ **Calendar UI (50%)**: FullCalendar integration (mock data)
- ‚úÖ **Navigation & Layout (100%)**: Responsive navbar with icons, routing setup

### üöß Currently Working On:
- **Database Schema Design** (Phase 1.1)
- **Replacing mock data with real Supabase queries**
- **Building CRUD operations**

### üìã Quick Navigation:
- **[MISSION_TRACKER.md](./MISSION_TRACKER.md)** ‚Üê Use this for daily coding tasks
- **This file (DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md)** ‚Üê Use this for long-term planning

### üéØ This Week's Priority:
1. Design database schema for `clients`, `pipeline_cards`, `events`, and `flaker_cards` tables
2. Create tables in Supabase dashboard
3. Build TypeScript types in `lib/types/database.ts`
4. Start building data fetching functions

---

## Overview
This roadmap outlines the development of Simple Ink Studios, a comprehensive client management platform designed specifically for tattoo artists and studios. The platform will help artists track clients, manage appointments, handle deposits, and streamline communication.

**Philosophy**: This plan extends beyond the 6-phase tactical approach in MISSION_TRACKER.md. Think of MISSION_TRACKER as your sprint guide (next 2-3 months) and this file as your vision document (3-6+ months).

## Notes & Considerations

### Prioritization Philosophy
1. **User Value**: Features that directly help artists manage clients better
2. **Technical Foundation**: Infrastructure that enables future features
3. **Differentiation**: Features that set us apart from generic CRM tools
4. **Feedback-Driven**: Let actual user feedback guide priorities

### Development Approach
- **Agile Sprints**: 2-week sprints with clear deliverables
- **MVP Mindset**: Ship minimal viable versions and iterate
- **User Testing**: Test with real artists throughout development
- **Documentation**: Document as you build, not after

### Resource Planning
- **Solo Development**: Realistic timeline for one developer
- **External Services**: Leverage existing services (Twilio, Resend) rather than building from scratch
- **Open Source**: Use battle-tested libraries and frameworks
- **Community**: Engage with tattoo artist community for feedback and validation
