## üìã What's Next (Manual Steps Required)

### Step 1: Capture Visual Assets

You need to capture 4 files:

1. **Dashboard Screenshot**
   - Navigate to: http://localhost:3001/dashboard
   - Capture: `public/screenshots/dashboard.png`

2. **Pipeline Screenshot**
   - Navigate to: http://localhost:3001/content/pipeline
   - Capture: `public/screenshots/pipeline.png`

3. **Create Client GIF**
   - Record: Creating a new client (3-5 seconds)
   - Save as: `public/gifs/create-client.gif`

4. **Drag & Drop GIF**
   - Record: Dragging a client between stages (2-4 seconds)
   - Save as: `public/gifs/drag-drop.gif`

**Detailed instructions:** See `public/CAPTURE_INSTRUCTIONS.md`

### Step 2: Add Images to Landing Page

Once you have the files, update `app/page.tsx`:

Find these 4 locations and uncomment the `src` prop:

```tsx
// Line ~108
<FeatureImage
  src="/screenshots/pipeline.png"  // ‚Üê Uncomment this line
  ...
/>

// Line ~127
<FeatureImage
  src="/gifs/create-client.gif"  // ‚Üê Uncomment this line
  ...
/>

// Line ~146
<FeatureImage
  src="/gifs/drag-drop.gif"  // ‚Üê Uncomment this line
  ...
/>

// Line ~165
<FeatureImage
  src="/screenshots/dashboard.png"  // ‚Üê Uncomment this line
  ...
/>
```

### Step 3: Test & Review

1. Visit http://localhost:3001/ (make sure you're logged out to see landing page)
2. Scroll through entire page
3. Verify all images/GIFs display correctly
4. Test both light and dark modes
5. Test on mobile viewport (browser DevTools)

### Step 4: Commit Changes

Once everything looks good, commit:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Complete landing page with visual assets"
git push
```
