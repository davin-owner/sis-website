## 💡 FOCUS RULES

### DO:
- Ship features that users NEED (pipeline, workers, time tracking)
- Cold call 100+ studios per day after launch
- Fix bugs immediately
- Iterate based on real user feedback
- Keep scope focused on MVP

### DON'T:
- Add features users haven't asked for
- Spend more than 1 day on landing page
- Optimize prematurely (only fix real bottlenecks)
- Build features for imaginary scale problems
- Let perfect be the enemy of good

---

## 🔥 MOTIVATION

**Current Progress:** ~85% to MVP
**Days to Launch:** 5 days
**Daily mantra:** "Ship it, get users, iterate"

**Remember:**
- Imperfect action beats perfect planning
- Real users > perfect features
- Launch anxiety is normal - ship anyway
- Your first 100 users will forgive bugs if you fix them fast
- Revenue validates the business, not features
