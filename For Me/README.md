## 💡 Best Practices

### Code
- Always use server actions for database operations
- Always verify `shop_id` + `user_id` before queries
- Use TypeScript types from `lib/database.ts`
- Follow naming convention: `.client.tsx` for client components, `.server.tsx` for server

### Performance
- No console.logs in production code
- Avoid N+1 queries (sort AFTER loops, not inside)
- Use optimistic updates for better UX
- Keep bundle size under 500KB

### Documentation
- Update START_HERE after each session
- Keep MISSION_TRACKER current
- Add comments explaining "why" not "what"
