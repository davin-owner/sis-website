# Session Context - Simple Ink Studios Development

**Last Updated:** 2025-01-16
**Session Focus:** Database Foundation for Pipeline CRM - COMPLETE! 🎉

---

## 🎯 What We're Building

A tattoo shop management platform where:
- **Users** (shop owners/managers) log in
- System checks if they have **shop access**
- If yes → Load their shop dashboard
- If no → Show shop creation flow

---

## ✅ MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED!

**The complete authentication and shop creation flow is WORKING!**

### What's Working Now:
1. ✅ User sign up and login
2. ✅ Dashboard checks for shop access
3. ✅ Redirects to onboarding if no shops
4. ✅ Shop creation form with validation
5. ✅ Creates shop + adds user as owner (using Server Actions)
6. ✅ Redirects to dashboard showing shop name
7. ✅ Full data flow from form → database → dashboard

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Decisions Made

### User-Centric Design Philosophy
- **Think from customer perspective** - "What shops can I access?"
- NOT shop-centric ("Who owns this shop?")
- Multi-shop support from day 1

### Database Structure - Junction Table Pattern

```
auth.users (Supabase managed)
    ↓
shop_users (junction table - OUR access control)
├─ user_id → auth.users.id
├─ shop_id → shops_tables.shop_id
├─ role: text (owner/sub_owner/manager/custom)
├─ permissions: jsonb {can_edit_settings, can_manage_workers, etc}
├─ last_accessed_at: timestamp
└─ UNIQUE(user_id, shop_id) - prevents duplicates

shops_tables (shop data)
├─ shop_id
├─ shop_name
├─ shop_address
├─ amount_of_workers
├─ shop_owner (kept for backwards compat, but junction table is source of truth)
└─ ...
```

**Why Junction Table?**
- User can access multiple shops with different roles
- Each row = one relationship (not arrays)
- Easy queries: "Get all shops for user X" or "Get all users for shop Y"
- Standard, scalable pattern

---

## 🔄 The Login → Dashboard Flow (IMPLEMENTED & WORKING!)

```
User logs in (Supabase Auth)
    ↓
Dashboard (Server Component) checks:
    1. Get user from auth
    2. Query shop_users WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    3. Check: shops.length > 0?
    ↓
YES - Has Shops:
    - Load shops[0] (most recently accessed)
    - Pass to ShopProvider (React Context)
    - Render dashboard with shop data
    ↓
NO - No Shops:
    - Redirect to /onboarding
    - Show "Create Your Shop" form
    - Use Server Action to create shop
    - Redirect back to dashboard
```

## ✅ COMPLETED THIS SESSION (2025-10-16)

### 1. Local Development Environment Setup ✅
**Files:** `.env.local`, `.env.development`, `.env.production.local`
- ✅ Configured local Supabase (http://127.0.0.1:54321)
- ✅ Set up environment switching (local vs production)
- ✅ Fixed CSP (Content Security Policy) to allow localhost connections
- ✅ Created `For Me/DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md` with full instructions

**Key Learning:** Local dev = work anywhere, no internet needed after setup!

### 2. Fixed RLS Policy Issues ✅
**The Problem:** Local Supabase's `auth.uid()` doesn't work with JWT validation
**The Solution:** Disable RLS for local development

- ✅ RLS **disabled** locally (safe, on your machine only)
- ✅ RLS **enabled** in production (cloud Supabase handles JWT properly)
- ✅ Created `For Me/RLS_POLICIES_EXPLAINED.md` documenting the setup
- ✅ All policies exist and are correct - they just need proper JWT validation

### 3. Implemented Server Actions ✅
**File:** `/app/onboarding/actions.ts`
- ✅ Created `createShop()` Server Action
- ✅ Runs on server with proper auth context
- ✅ Validates form inputs
- ✅ Creates shop in `shops_tables`
- ✅ Adds user to `shop_users` as owner with full permissions
- ✅ Rollback on error (deletes shop if junction table insert fails)
- ✅ Returns success/error status

**Why Server Actions?**
- More secure (runs on server, not client)
- Better performance (less client JS)
- Production-ready (will work with RLS in cloud Supabase)
- Modern Next.js best practice

### 4. Updated Onboarding Form ✅
**File:** `/app/onboarding/page.tsx`
- ✅ Uses Server Action instead of client-side function
- ✅ Proper loading states (`isSubmitting`)
- ✅ Error display with styled error message
- ✅ Form validation (`required` attributes)
- ✅ Disabled inputs during submission
- ✅ Client-side redirect on success

### 5. Created Helper Functions ✅
**File:** `/lib/supabase/data/user-shops.js`
- ✅ `getUserShops(userId, supabaseClient)` - Fetches all shops user can access
- ✅ `getActiveShop(shopId, userId, supabaseClient)` - Fetches specific shop
- ✅ `createShopWithOwner(userId, shopData, supabaseClient)` - Creates shop + owner
- ✅ Functions accept optional Supabase client for flexibility
- ✅ Flattens nested data for easier use

### 6. Implemented Dashboard Shop Check ✅
**File:** `/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
- ✅ Checks user authentication
- ✅ Calls `getUserShops()` to check shop access
- ✅ Redirects to `/onboarding` if no shops
- ✅ Loads dashboard with `activeShop` (most recently accessed)
- ✅ Wraps everything in `<ShopProvider>` for context
- ✅ Displays shop name: "Dashboard for: [Shop Name]"

### 7. Created ShopContext ✅
**File:** `/lib/contexts/shop-context.tsx`
- ✅ React Context for passing shop data to child components
- ✅ TypeScript interface for Shop type
- ✅ `ShopProvider` component to wrap dashboard
- ✅ `useShop()` hook for child components to access shop data

### 8. Fixed Next.js Configuration ✅
**File:** `next.config.ts`
- ✅ Updated CSP to allow localhost connections in development
- ✅ Keeps production secure (only HTTPS in production)

### 9. Documentation Created ✅
- ✅ `For Me/DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md` - Complete local dev guide
- ✅ `For Me/RLS_POLICIES_EXPLAINED.md` - RLS policies explained
- ✅ `For Me/SESSION_CONTEXT.md` - This file (context for next session)

## 🚀 How the System Works Now

### Complete User Journey:

1. **New User:**
   - Goes to `/auth/sign-up`
   - Creates account
   - Redirected to `/dashboard`
   - No shops found → Redirected to `/onboarding`
   - Fills out "Create Your Shop" form
   - Submits → Server Action creates shop + adds as owner
   - Redirected to `/dashboard`
   - Sees: "Dashboard for: [Their Shop Name]"

2. **Returning User:**
   - Goes to `/auth/login`
   - Logs in
   - Redirected to `/dashboard`
   - Shop found → Loads dashboard with their shop data
   - Sees: "Dashboard for: [Their Shop Name]"

3. **Multi-Shop User (Future):**
   - Would see dropdown to switch between shops
   - Each shop stored in `shop_users` with different roles
   - Can have different permissions per shop

---

## 🔐 RLS Policy Status

### Local Development:
- **RLS: DISABLED** for shops_tables and shop_users
- **Why:** Local Supabase doesn't validate JWT tokens properly
- **Safe:** Database only accessible from your computer
- **Benefit:** Fast development without auth complications

### Production (Cloud Supabase):
- **RLS: ENABLED** with proper policies
- **Works:** Cloud Supabase validates JWT correctly
- **Secure:** Users can only access their own shops
- **Policies exist and are correct** - just need proper JWT validation

**See `For Me/RLS_POLICIES_EXPLAINED.md` for full details**

## 📝 Key Concepts Learned

### New Concepts This Session:
1. **Server Actions** - Next.js's way of handling form submissions securely
2. **Local vs Production Environments** - Different configs for different stages
3. **RLS Limitations** - Local Supabase JWT validation issues
4. **CSP (Content Security Policy)** - Browser security for API connections
5. **Environment Variable Management** - .env files for different environments

### Patterns Used:
- **Server Actions** - Modern form handling in Next.js 15
- **React Context** - Passing shop data to child components
- **TypeScript Interfaces** - Type safety for shop objects
- **Optional Parameters** - Functions that work in multiple contexts
- **Error Rollback** - Cleaning up failed database operations
- **Progressive Enhancement** - Forms work without JavaScript

---

## 🎯 Next Steps (For Next Session)

### Immediate Priorities:

1. **Test the Complete Flow End-to-End**
   - Create a new test account
   - Go through onboarding
   - Verify shop appears on dashboard
   - Log out and log back in
   - Verify shop persists

2. **Improve Dashboard UI**
   - Currently shows mock data (hardcoded task lists, etc.)
   - Need to connect to real data from database
   - Add shop switcher (for multi-shop support)
   - Show real shop information

3. **Build Out Shop Features**
   - Shop settings page (edit shop name, address, etc.)
   - Worker management (add/remove workers)
   - Lead tracking (the original purpose!)
   - Calendar/appointments
   - Pipeline stats (real data, not mock)

4. **Cookie Management for Active Shop**
   - Currently using `shops[0]` (most recent)
   - Add cookie to remember active shop across sessions
   - Would enable shop switcher dropdown
   - See SHOP_CREATION_FLOW.md for cookie strategy

### Nice-to-Have:

5. **Style Improvements**
   - Onboarding page could use better styling
   - Add animations/transitions
   - Better loading states
   - Success messages

6. **Error Handling**
   - Better error messages for users
   - Retry mechanisms
   - Network error handling

7. **Testing**
   - Test multi-shop scenarios
   - Test permissions system
   - Test edge cases (network failures, etc.)

## 💭 Critical Insights

### Technical Decisions:
1. **Server Actions > Client Functions** - More secure, better performance, production-ready
2. **Disable RLS Locally** - Avoids JWT validation issues, safe for local dev
3. **Junction Table Pattern** - Scalable, standard way to handle multi-shop access
4. **React Context for Shop Data** - Avoids prop drilling, easy to use in any component
5. **Environment Separation** - Different configs for local vs production

### Development Philosophy:
- **User-first thinking** - Build for how users think, not how database is structured
- **Progressive complexity** - Start simple, add features incrementally
- **Document everything** - Future you will thank present you
- **Test frequently** - Don't build too much before testing
- **Production-ready from start** - Even local code should work in production

## 🎯 SESSION 2025-01-16 - Database Foundation for CRM

**Goal:** Set up complete data foundation for MVP weekend sprint

### What We Accomplished Tonight:

#### 1. Database Migration Created & Applied ✅
**File:** `supabase/migrations/02_add_pipeline_tracking.sql`

**Changes:**
- Added `pipeline_stage` column to `shop_leads` (TEXT, default 'leads')
- Added `sort_order` column to `shop_leads` (INTEGER, default 0)
- Created index on (shop_id, pipeline_stage) for query performance
- Added CHECK constraint for valid pipeline stages
- Added documentation comments

**Pipeline Stages:**
- `leads` - Initial contact
- `consulting` - In consultation phase
- `apts-made` - Appointment scheduled
- `inking` - Currently getting tattooed
- `follow-ups` - Post-service follow-up

**Why This Matters:**
- Clients can now be tracked through sales pipeline
- Drag & drop position persists to database
- Foundation for entire CRM feature set

#### 2. Security Architecture Documented ✅
**File:** `For Me/DATA_ISOLATION_SECURITY.md`

**Key Learnings:**
- Multi-tenant SaaS requires defense in depth
- 6 layers of security to prevent data leaks
- TypeScript enforces compile-time safety (required parameters)
- Access control middleware verifies permissions
- RLS as final safety net (disabled locally, enabled in production)
- Standard pattern for all data functions

**Critical Pattern:**
```typescript
async function getData(shopId: string, userId: string, supabase: SupabaseClient) {
  // 1. Validate inputs
  // 2. Verify access via shop_users table
  // 3. Query with shop_id filter
  // 4. Return typed data
}
```

#### 3. Weekend MVP Roadmap Created ✅
**File:** `For Me/WEEKEND_MVP_ROADMAP.md`

**The Plan:**
- **Friday (after work):** Complete data layer (types, functions, server actions)
- **Saturday:** Connect UI to data, build client modal, add shop switcher
- **Sunday:** Testing, bug fixes, documentation, git commits

**MVP Success Criteria:**
- User can add/edit clients
- Clients appear in pipeline columns
- Drag & drop persists to database
- Multi-shop support with switcher
- Real dashboard stats
- Data isolation works (each shop sees only their data)

#### 4. Architecture Understanding Deep Dive ✅

**How The System Works:**
```
Browser (Client Components)
    ↕ (calls)
Server Actions (mutations)
    ↕ (uses)
Data Functions (queries)
    ↕ (accesses)
Supabase Database
```

**Key Concepts Mastered:**
- Server Components vs Client Components
- Server Actions for mutations
- Data isolation via shop_id filtering
- Multi-tenancy architecture
- Migration-based database changes
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies

### Current State:

**What's Working:**
- ✅ User authentication
- ✅ Shop creation flow
- ✅ Dashboard loads for shop owners
- ✅ Multi-shop architecture (shop_users junction table)
- ✅ UI components & design system
- ✅ Mock pipeline with drag & drop
- ✅ Database has pipeline tracking columns

**What's Next (Tomorrow After Work):**
1. TypeScript types for database entities
2. Access control utility functions
3. Pipeline data functions (CRUD operations)
4. Server actions for mutations
5. Test with manual data

**Then (This Weekend):**
6. Connect pipeline page to real data
7. Build client modal (add/edit)
8. Build shop switcher component
9. Connect dashboard stats
10. End-to-end testing

### Files Created Tonight:

```
supabase/migrations/
└─ 02_add_pipeline_tracking.sql ← NEW

For Me/
├─ DATA_ISOLATION_SECURITY.md ← NEW
└─ WEEKEND_MVP_ROADMAP.md ← NEW
```

### Technical Decisions Made:

1. **Pipeline Storage:** Columns in shop_leads (simple, no junction table)
2. **Sort Order:** Integer with gaps (efficient drag & drop)
3. **Security:** Multi-layered defense (TypeScript + access checks + RLS)
4. **Data Functions:** Always require shopId + userId (type-safe)
5. **Error Handling:** Return { data, error } objects (no crashes)
6. **Server Actions:** Modern Next.js 15 pattern (type-safe, secure)

### Tomorrow's Starting Point:

1. Read `For Me/DATA_ISOLATION_SECURITY.md` thoroughly
2. Review `For Me/WEEKEND_MVP_ROADMAP.md`
3. Start with TypeScript types (lib/types/database.ts)
4. Build data functions with security patterns
5. Ship the MVP this weekend!
