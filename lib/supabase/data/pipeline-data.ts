  if shopid null send to dashboard and it will let them choose if they have other shops if no other shops go back to onboarding ** this logic should be the default for access too**
  if the db qurey fails send the error and retry and if it keeps failing we will have to see what the problem is ** it shouldnt fail unless no access or null**
  if the stage has no clients still show the column cause they need to see no one is there and they need to move clients there in the future 
  yes we want the fetch the whole thing cause that way we as the developer can debug behind the screen and ui and possible future for previous stage for roll back feature ** after mvp**
