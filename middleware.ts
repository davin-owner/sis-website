/**
 * MIDDLEWARE - The "Bouncer" of Your App
 *
 * WHAT IS MIDDLEWARE?
 * Middleware runs BEFORE every page loads. It's like a bouncer at a club
 * who checks IDs before letting people in.
 *
 * THE FLOW:
 * 1. User visits ANY page on your site
 * 2. THIS code runs first (before the page)
 * 3. We check: Are they logged in?
 * 4. Based on that, we either:
 *    - Let them continue to the page they want
 *    - Redirect them somewhere else
 *
 * YOUR SPECIFIC LOGIC:
 * - Logged in user visits / → Redirect to /dashboard
 * - Not logged in visits /dashboard → Redirect to /
 * - Not logged in visits / → Show landing page (no redirect)
 * - Logged in visits /dashboard → Show dashboard (no redirect)

 * SKIP:
 * - /_next/* (Next.js internal files)
 * - /api/* (API routes don't need this check)
 * - Static files (images, fonts, etc.)
